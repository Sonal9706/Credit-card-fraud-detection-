# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions by utilizing multiple machine learning models to improve detection accuracy.

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

2. Train the model: 
    python train.py
    

3. Model save:
    random_forest_model.pkl
    scaler.pkl
    

## Directory Structure
- train.py: Script for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- requirements.txt: Dependencies for the project.
- random_forest_model.pkl: Trained model saved as a Pickle file.
- scaler.pkl: Scaler used during data processing.

## Future Work
- Explore additional data augmentation methods
- Further hyperparameter tuning
- Trying different algorithms or ensemble methods

## Conclusion
This project presents a comprehensive approach to credit card fraud detection, highlighting the significance of managing imbalanced data effectively and conducting thorough model evaluation.
